# 'Breaking Bad'-ify
### Description:
This script takes text-files as input and constructs each word using the symbols from the periodic table of elements (to the highest degree possible). As you may have noticed, this style is reminescent of the logo of the show Breaking Bad.

To use the script on your own files, use the command:
`$ python3 BreakingBadify sampleFile`

Your images can be found in `out/`.

You may find sample images in `out/`.
